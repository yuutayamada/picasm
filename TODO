* Toolbar menu

* Lookup-table generator

* Maybe some yasnippet templates for common control structures?

* I don't think labels on the same line as instructions are indented properly

* More detailed chip database 
This would require manual entry of chip details off of the datasheets,
and there are hundreds of chips. Not sure when I'll have time to do
this.
* Configuration word editor
Depends on getting more chip info into the database so we know which
CONFIG elements a given chip has.
* Changing the selected chip should edit/insert the "list p=<chip>" and "#include <chip.inc>" directives

* Changing the selected chip should force a recalculate of the configuration word
Depends on configuration word support, above.
